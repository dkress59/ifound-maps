# iFound.one

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This Web App is almost progressive, solely the no-js prerender still needs to be added. [Check it out!](https://www.iFound.one)



### Front-End

This is the repository for the app's Front-End. Please keep in mind this was a prototype development process, and it was wrapped up in just a few days.
I had just switched to Functional Components and Hook Calls, so you won't find a very diverse programming paradigm.



### To Do

* Redesign whole UI
* Add Pagination to Gallery
* And remove all Bootstrap Dependencies
* Add Unit Tests
* Turn off Morgan
* Also remove nodemon from project
