# iFound.one

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This Web App is almost progressive, solely the no-js prerender still needs to be added. [Check it out!](https://www.iFound.one)



### Front-End

This is the repository for the app's Front-End. Heavy use of OpenStreetMap and Leaflet.js which I am a big fan of, and therefore also of MapBox. I had just switched to Functional Components and Hook Calls with React.js, so you won't find a very diverse programming paradigm.
The Front-End currently runs on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), where it was deployed with the [create-react-app-buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack), but I am thinking about moving it to a Apache Server that I own.
__Please keep in mind this was a prototype development process, and it was wrapped up in just a few days.__
